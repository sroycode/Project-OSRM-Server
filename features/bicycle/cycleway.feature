    Background:
        Given the profile "bicycle"

    Scenario: Bike - Cycle tracks/lanes should enable biking
        Then routability should be
            | highway     | cycleway     | bothw |

    Scenario: Bike - Invalid cycleway tags
        Then routability should be

    Scenario: Bike - Access tags should overwrite cycleway access
        Then routability should be
            | highway     | cycleway | access | bothw |
            | motorway    | track    | no     |       |
